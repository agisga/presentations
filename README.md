This is a repository for my presentations that have done in reveal.js

This repository was originally forked from <https://github.com/Arty-chan/presentations.git>.
If you want to know how to make your own, you can check Archy-chan's blog post on [using reveal.js with GitHub Pages](https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/using-reveal-js-on-github-pages-for-your-presentations/) or the resources linked to therein.
